Hence, regardless of target audience class, source and medium should be considered first to better justify cost of marketing campaigns for optimal lead generation results. Though having a lower average cost per acquisition, the standard deviation is higher. Thus less significant factors like product interest, persona and country can be considered to get most cost effective marketing strategy.
